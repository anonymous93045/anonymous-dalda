<instruction>
1. You must create a sentence that describes the class-oriented image corresponding to the <dataset description> and <class>.
2. While maintaining the properties of each <class>, we will add external elements other than the class to the statement. 
3. properties such as view, color, action, background, foreground, and environment information must be added to the sentence.
4. The attributes added to each sentence must fit the <dataset description> and be realistic. 
5. make 1 sentence for each class in <class>.

So you must create 1 sentence for each of the 102 classes.
Each class should not be included in the description of any other class.

The output should always be in json format, no text other than json is required.
